# How I built ESP32 Airtag tracker
This DIY project is inspired by[OpenHaystack](https://hackaday.com/tag/openhaystack/)

Are you tired of losing your keys, your dog, or perhaps even your mind, due to the constant stress of misplaced items? Fear no more! I have embarked on a thrilling mission to end the cycle of lost-and-found and I have the perfect remedy for you - a homemade tracker powered by ESP32 and OpenHaystack. If tech jargon such as UART, GPIO, and Firmware are your kind of punchlines, then this epic chronicle of tech-infused wizardry will have you hooked faster than you can say "Where's my phone?"

So, before we get lost in the intricate jungles of code and circuit boards, remember the golden rule - This journey is not about the destination, but the hilarious mishaps, unexpected detours, and triumphant breakthroughs we encounter along the way. So hold onto your hats (and possibly your soldering iron), folks! It's time to make like a detective and get our tracking on!

### OpenHaystack and Airtag (optional)

> OpenHaystack allows you to track non-Apple devices on the Find Me tracking network, you will need a Mac computer to actually see where your device is. The teamâ€™s software requires a computer running macOS 11 (Big Sur) to run, and judging by the fact it integrates with Apple Mail to pull the tracking data through a private API, weâ€™re going to assume this isnâ€™t something that can easily be recreated in a platform-agnostic way.

## Install OpenHaystack
Follow the official instruction at [GitHub](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack)

## Add a new device

Click on "+" and add a new device (they call it accessory).

## Prepare ESP32

Connect USB-UART to the MCU in the following way. I didn't use a development board, therefore I connected USB UART in the following way

|ESP32|UART|
|----|----|
|GPIO0|DTR|
|EN|RTS|
|RX|TX|
|TX|RX|
|VCC|3.3V|
|GND|GND|

> `esptool.py`  resets ESP32 automatically by asserting DTR and RTS control lines of the USB to serial converter chip, i.e., FTDI, CP210x, or CH340x. The DTR and RTS control lines are in turn connected to **GPIO0 and EN (CHIP_PU) pins of ESP32, thus changes in the voltage levels of DTR and RTS will boot the ESP32 into Firmware Download mode.**

## Check that ESP32/UART are connected correctly [optional]

If `esptool.py` is able to read chip_id, everything is good.

```bash
$ esptool.py chip_id

## Flash a firmware
There is a "Deploy" context menu item, but I didn't work for me, therefore I did the following:

```bash
cd /Applications/OpenHaystack.app/Contents/Resources/ESP32/
export PUBKEY=<base64 advertisment from the previous step>
./flash_esp32.sh -p /dev/cu.usbserial-0001
```
Example output

```
I noticed, that it doesn't reset after erasing MCU, so I removed `--after no_reset` line in the flash script.

## Pull-up EN pin
Don't forget to put pull-up resistor to EN pin. It has to be on logical high level to switch on ESP32.
