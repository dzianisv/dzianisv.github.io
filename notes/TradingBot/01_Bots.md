86% of money moved in crypto trading involves crypto trading bots. 38% of all crypto traders say they have bots and 66% employ margined trading to amplify profits. Most of 83.3% of these are deployed on Binance, then Coinbase Pro, Bitfinex, Kraken, Poloniex, Bitstamp, Kucoin, and Bitmex. [1]

Most traders or 94% using bots hold between $5,000 to $100,000 worth of crypto. [1]

Trading with bots doesn’t mean there won’t be losses but a cryptocurrency arbitrage bot minimizes trading risks, especially in a volatile market. This is in addition to automating it. [1]

Automated market-making systems are different from decentralized crypto exchanges. Instead of centralized order books, the exchanges rely on a liquidity pool. Each pair has its liquidity pool. [1]

Economic theory states that arbitrage should not be able to occur because if markets are efficient, there would be no such opportunities to profit. However, in reality, markets can be inefficient and arbitrage can happen. When arbitrageurs identify and then correct such mispricings (by buying them low and selling them high), though, they work to move prices back in line with market efficiency. This means that any arbitrage opportunities that do occur are short-lived. (3)
