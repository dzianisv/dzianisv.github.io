# Github Gmail notifications filter
Short note about filtering.

At my current position I owns some microservices in the github monorepo.
The monorepo generates a lot of notifcations when someone contributes and creates PRs there.
It creates a lot of notifications that I would avoid, therefore I setup a filter in gmail for that

1. Click on the  'Create filter' icon, it is in the right cornet of the search bar.
2.  Setup filter

3. Click 'Create filter'
4. Check 'Delete'
5. Save

In subject I set a blockchain protcols I am interested in, and `-` means not. So if there an email with for a PR for another protocol, gmail going to delete it.

Keep you mind far away from distraction. Use gmail filters and meditations!
