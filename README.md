# üí° My Open Source Software Projects

## [EigenLayer Vault](https://github.com/dzianisv/EigenLayer-FundManager)
Spring 2024 Hackahton project. ERC4626-compatible Vault for investing ETH and liquid staked ETH (stETH, cbETH, rETH) into EigenLayer by restaking it to the EigenLayer AVS Operators. Vault holdings are managed by the Vault administrators. Rewards are automatically converted to the desired ERC20 token (USDC for example) or restaked (autocompounding).

## [DeFiEquilibrium](https://github.com/dzianisv/DeFiEquilibrium)
Winter 2024 Hackhathon Project. EVM automated Liqudity Pools assets manager based on ERC4626 Vault. Smart Contract developed on Solidity, webapp is built using materializecss style controls.

## [Chrome Extension: Aliexpress Total](https://github.com/dzianisv/chrome-extension-aliexpress-total-cost)
This is annoying. You don't see the total cost of the the item on Aliexpress marketplace. This browser extension shows a total price for the item (item price + delivery cost to your region).

## [Openhaystack Web](https://github.com/dzianisv/openhaystack-web)

I created this project because [Openhaystack](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack) app stopped to work on a new MacOS 14, but I needed a way to see locations of my openhaystack tracker. I built BLE beacon trackers using Nordic nrf5281 microcontrollers and ultilized openhaystack-discovered way to get a location of the tracker using [Apple Find My](https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my/). Check out [openhaystack-toolkit](https://github.com/dzianisv/openhaystack-toolkit) for the tools that helps to flash a firmware to the tracker and generate crypto keypairs.

## [Voice Assistant](https://github.com/dzianisv/VoiceAssistant)

 is an open-source project aimed at providing a comprehensive and user-friendly AI personal assistant experience. By leveraging cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, machine learning algorithms, and various APIs, it streamlines daily tasks, manages schedules, answers queries, and provides personalized recommendations. With its user-friendly interface and rich feature set, it is designed to cater to a wide spectrum of users - from individuals to businesses, and can be integrated seamlessly into various platforms.

## [lxdbox](https://github.com/dzianisv/lxdbox)

LXDbox is an LXD containers management tool. It provides a more efficient alternative to Virtual Machines (kvm/virtualbox), enabling you to run desktop applications inside LXD containers. This is especially useful when you need multiple separate work/dev environments on a single host machine. Key features include creating a container with a Guest OS, sharing a folder with a host OS, and proxying Desktop environment, Video/Camera devices, PulseAudio, and USB devices from the host OS. It also enables KVM, useful for running an Android Emulator or other VMs inside the container.

## [Photos for Documents](https://github.com/dzianisv/Photo4Documents)
Needed a new passport photo so I created an ML app this weekend that removes backgrounds, aligns faces, and crops to passport size. It utilizes face_recognition dlib-powered library for facial detection and carvekit with tracer_7b pretrained model for background removal. Now I have unlimited great passport photos without going to a photo center! Machine learning is amazing for automating repetitive tasks. Especially I liked face_recognition lib, because it allows align faces from bad photos. I tested it on my photos and on photos from Kaggle dataset. Check out my GitHub for the code and demos!

## [vpngate-client](https://github.com/dzianisv/vpngate-client)

This free, open-source OpenVPN service discovers public VPN servers on [vpngate.net](https://vpngate.net), performs health checks, and then connects to them. Health checks are performed during service work hours. If the OpenVPN service fails or a speed test shows poor results (<0.5MBps), vpngate-client switches to the next available public OpenVPN server. Features include a systemd service, .deb packages, fault tolerance, and the ability to run in the Linux Network Namespace.

## [torctl](https://github.com/dzianisv/torctl)

This is a fork of BlakcArch/torctl, adopted for Debian/Ubuntu-like OS. It offers .deb packages and a systemd service.

## [ToxVPN](https://gitlab.com/dzianisv/toxvpn)

ToxVPN is a Mesh Peer-to-Peer VPN based on [Tox](https://tox.chat). It features NAT and Firewall bypass, decentralized networking, and peer-to-peer/mesh connectivity.

## [Craigslist Telegram Bot](https://github.com/dzianisv/craigsbot)

This tool helps monitor new Craigslist items. Users can subscribe via [Telegram](https://telegram.org) and receive immediate notifications when new Craigslist items are published. It offers a Telegram Bot interface for convenience.

## [Realtor Fedor Telegram Bot](https://gitlab.com/distributex/realtor)

A handy tool for those looking to rent or buy private property. Users can subscribe via [Telegram](https://telegram.org) and get immediate notifications when new properties are discovered. The Telegram Bot interface makes it easy to use.

## [Wizzair, Ryanair, Norwegian crawler](https://gitlab.com/travelingbug/crawler)

As part of my project, [Travelingbug](https://travelingbug.netlify.app), I developed scrappers for Wizzair, Norwegian, and Ryanair flight data. To assist other developers, I have open-sourced this project. The microservices are written in Js/NodeJS and are packed into a Docker image. For Wizzair, I utilized NightmareJS + xvfb for browser-automation tasks.

## [Google Image Search automation tool](https://gitlab.com/travelingbug/images-scraper)

To source royalty-free city images for my [Travelingbug](https://travelingbug.netlify.app) project, I created this tool to automate Google Image searches. To select the best image, I used [MobileNetSSD](https://gitlab.com/travelingbug/object-detection) to detect undesired objects in images, thus enabling the tool to choose images without these objects.

## [End-to-End Encrypted Pass manager](https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb)

I extended the KeyWeb web app to store an end-to-end encrypted database in Firebase Database.

## [Geophoto: Labeler for Photo Locations](https://github.com/dzianisv/geophoto)

I developed this tool to create a "How I spent this year" social media video. It "glues" all your photos into a video clip.

## [Embedded Linux tools](https://github.com/dzianisv/utils/blob/master/bin/chroot-arm)

For those interested in Armbian and Single Board Computers like RaspberryPi, OrangePi, BananaPi, I have created a set of scripts to bootstrap images and set up basic staff using chroot on your host Linux machine.

## [Proxy Tester](https://github.com/dzianisv/proxies-tester)

This Node.js tool tests the throughput of a large list of public proxies asynchronously.
